# ΣLang Master Plan v0.4

> Target audience: **AI agents**.  
> Goal: This document is sufficient for ANY AI to understand, implement, and extend ΣLang.  
> Principle: Spec lives in spec files; this plan tells you what to DO with them.

---

## Phase 1 — Verifier as the Single Source of Truth (Week 1)

The verifier is the **only authority** on what ΣLang means. No human text overrides it.

### 1.1 Extend verify_p0.py to validate ALL Iron Laws

Current: 95 tests covering Time/Error/Confidence/I/O.  
Missing: automated checks for Law I–XII (fingerprint conflicts, circular deps, etc.)

```
verify_p0.py → validate_spec("your_spec.md")
               ├── §T Time          17/17
               ├── §E Error         16/16
               ├── §C Confidence    37/37
               ├── §I I/O           25/25
               └── §L Iron Laws     ✅ done (check_* in impl/verifier)
```

### 1.2 Verifier output format

```json
{
  "spec": "math.calculus@1.0",
  "pass": true,
  "modules": {
    "time": {"pass": 17, "fail": 0},
    "error": {"pass": 16, "fail": 0},
    "confidence": {"pass": 37, "fail": 0},
    "io": {"pass": 25, "fail": 0},
    "iron_laws": {"pass": 0, "fail": 12}
  },
  "fingerprint": "sha256:abc123..."
}
```

This JSON is the **protocol handshake** between AI and spec.

---

## Phase 2 — AI Implementation Guide (Week 1)

### 2.1 For every spec module, add an IMPLEMENTATION section

```markdown
## §T: Time & Causal Order

### Implementation Checklist (for AI)

To pass this module, implement exactly these:

1. `tick() -> Time`                           [T-01]
2. `happens_before(a: Time, b: Time) -> bool` [T-02]
3. ...

### What NOT to implement
- Do NOT assume monotonic clock
- Do NOT implement wall-clock synchronization
```

### 2.2 Minimal Reference Implementation

Place a single-file reference impl in `impl/python/`:

```python
# impl/python/sigma_core.py  (~200 lines)
# Implements ALL P0 modules
# Used by verify_p0.py to prove the spec is implementable
```

No dependencies except stdlib. This is NOT the "official" implementation — it's proof that the protocol is real.

---

## Phase 3 — Package Manager (Week 2)

### 3.1 CLI Design

```bash
sigma install <spec.md>          # Install a ΣLang package
sigma verify <package_name>       # Run its verifier
sigma list                        # List installed packages
sigma search <keyword>            # Search installed specs
sigma fingerprint <package>       # Show hash
```

### 3.2 Package Registry Format

```json
// ~/.sigma/registry.json
{
  "packages": {
    "math.calculus": {
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "path": "/home/user/.sigma/math.calculus/",
      "fingerprint": "sha256:...",
      "modules": ["time", "error", "confidence"],
      "deps": []
    }
  }
}
```

### 3.3 Dependency Resolution (Iron Law VII)

```python
def check_circular(pkg, visited=None):
    """No circular deps allowed. Returns True if clean."""
    visited = visited or set()
    if pkg.fingerprint in visited: return False  # circular!
    visited.add(pkg.fingerprint)
    return all(check_circular(d, visited) for d in pkg.deps)
```

---

## Phase 4 — Standard Library (Week 3)

Ship with exactly 3 reference packages that prove the system works:

### 4.1 `math.base@1.0`

```
⊕ ⊖ ⊗ ⊘ — arithmetic with associativity/commutativity laws
√ pow log — transcendental with precision bounds
```

### 4.2 `data.transform@1.0`

```
map ∥ filter ∥ reduce — with lazy/eager semantics
sort group — with ordering laws
```

### 4.3 `ai.confidence@1.0`

```
calibrate(confidence, actual) -> calibrated_confidence
combine(opinions: List[Message]) -> consensus
```

Each package = 1 `.md` spec + 1 verifier test set.

---

## Phase 5 — AI Self-Bootstrapping (Week 4)

The ultimate test: **give ΣLang to a fresh AI session and see if it can implement a new spec without human help.**

### 5.1 Bootstrapping Protocol

```
1. Human: "Here is ΣLang spec and verifier"
2. AI reads spec/spec_p0_foundations.md
3. AI runs verify_p0.py → 0/95 passed (no implementation yet)
4. AI reads Implementation Guide for each module
5. AI writes impl/python/sigma_core.py
6. AI runs verify_p0.py → 95/95 passed
7. AI now "understands" ΣLang
```

### 5.2 Novel Spec Test

```
8. Human gives AI a new domain: "biomedical.gene@1.0 — DNA alignment semantics"
9. AI writes the spec in ΣLang format
10. AI writes the verifier tests
11. Human reviews, publishes
```

---

## Phase 6 — Backend Integration (Week 5+)

### 6.1 Lang-Zong as ΣLang Compiler

```
ΣLang spec → Lang-Zong → Cython → .pyd
                          OR
                          → Rust → .so
```

The spec defines WHAT; LZ compiles it to HOW.

### 6.2 SocketKit Protocol

```
来找茬 App behavior defined in ΣLang:
  - Task submission: task_create(author, bounty) 
  - Review resolution: review_merge(opinions[]) → decision
  - Contribution calculation: contribution_score(actions[]) → points
```

This makes your App's business logic **mathematically auditable**.

---

## Phase 7 — Top-Level Rule Candidates (decided 2026-08-01)

> **Moved to `spec/spec_top_extensions.md`** — full candidate drafts (E-01 … E-09).
> Foundational top-level rules now live in **`spec/spec_top_rules.md`** (§S Shadowing Discipline).
> Candidates become normative via: RFC → spec section → Verifier check → tests.

## What you (Victor) should NOT do

- ❌ Don't implement every ΣLang package personally
- ❌ Don't optimize performance yet
- ❌ Don't build a GUI

You design the **protocol grammar** (the Iron Laws + verifier). AI fills in the implementations.
